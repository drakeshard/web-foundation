# Drakeshard Web Foundation

Shared web-game infrastructure for Drakeshard Studios.

## Repository scope

This repository contains renderer-neutral infrastructure and test support used by Drakeshard browser games. It does not provide a general-purpose game engine.

Initial shared packages:

- `@drakeshard/foundation`
- `@drakeshard/testing`

Renderer-specific integration remains application-local until repeated use justifies extraction.

## Technology baseline

- TypeScript
- pnpm workspace
- Vite
- Vitest
- Playwright
- Biome
- Preact for application UI
- Phaser for 2D presentation
- PlayCanvas for 2.5D presentation

## Architecture boundary

`@drakeshard/foundation` and game-domain code must not depend on Phaser, PlayCanvas, Preact, or renderer-specific objects.

See:

- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/policies/dependencies.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `SECURITY.md`

## Current phase

v0.1 is in the engineering-baseline phase. Feature implementation begins after the repository passes its Sprint 00 exit criteria, including a committed lockfile, reproducible frozen installs, required CI checks, and repository rule enforcement.
